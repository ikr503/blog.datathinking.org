A bike-sharing service was launched in Tarth in 2019. The usage patterns of this system in Tartu, especially in comparison with other cities, are not fully known. Data from Australia, UK and Canada show women use bikes at rates of only 21%,  29% and 30%, respectively, while in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands 40% or more of the rides are by females (Pucher & Buehler, 2008). This blog post analyzes differences in bike usage between males and females in Tartu based on 2022 bike-sharing usage data. 


## The Data 

Every ride taken in the bike-sharing system is recorded (https://geohub.tartulv.ee & https://ratas.tartu.ee/). Among the recorded information points, some relevant ones are:

- The first digits of a user's Personal Id Code, which represent the gender. An even number is for females, and an odd number is for male. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sit-defn-estonia-personal-identification-code?view=o365-worldwide)
- The location, date and time of taking out the bike, and where and when it was dropped off
- The type of bicycle used (electric or regular)
- And other less useful information!

This data can allow us learn more about trends and patterns in the gender of Tartu SmartBike users

## Raw Research: How many users of each gender

An approximately 60-40 split between males and females. This is close to other bike friendly countries in Europe, an encouraging sign.

## But what about during the winter?

The split is closer to 70-30, male to female respectively, in the winter.

## Why is that, are the bikes to blame?

There are no electric bikes offered during the winter months. Could the percentages between genders be greatly changed because of a lack of electric bikes offered? Looking at the preference in the summer months, when both types of bikes are fully available, we see that there is a difference between bicycle preferences. This would lead to inconclusive evidence on what drive this difference in demographics.

## Conclusion and sources

The data from the Tartu SmartBike usage shows that the share of bike use between genders is similar to other European bike-friendly nations. However, this share changes in the winter months.
